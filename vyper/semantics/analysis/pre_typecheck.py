# try to fold a node, swallowing exceptions. this function is very similar to
# `VyperNode.get_folded_value()` but additionally checks in the constants
# table if the node is a `Name` node.
#
# CMC 2023-12-30 a potential refactor would be to move this function into
# `Name._try_fold` (which would require modifying the signature of _try_fold to
# take an optional constants table as parameter). this would remove the
# need to use this function in conjunction with `get_descendants` since
# `VyperNode._try_fold()` already recurses. it would also remove the need
# for `VyperNode._set_folded_value()`.

Compiling a Contract
********************

Command-Line Tools
==================

Vyper includes the following command-line scripts for compiling contracts:

* ``vyper``: Compiles vyper contract files into ``LLL`` or bytecode
* ``vyper-json``: Provides a JSON interface to the compiler

.. note::

    The ``--help`` flag gives verbose explanations of how to use each of these scripts.

vyper
-----

``vyper`` provides command-line access to the compiler. It can generate various outputs including simple binaries, ASTs, interfaces and source mappings.

To compile a contract:

::

    $ vyper yourFileName.vy


Include the ``-f`` flag to specify which output formats to return. Use ``vyper --help`` for a full list of output options.

::

    $ vyper -f abi,bytecode,bytecode_runtime,ir,asm,source_map,method_identifiers yourFileName.vy

The ``-p`` flag allows you to set a root path that is used when searching for interface files to import.  If none is given, it will default to the current working directory. See :ref:`searching_for_imports` for more information.

::

    $ vyper -p yourProject yourProject/yourFileName.vy


vyper-json
----------

``vyper-json`` provides a JSON interface for the compiler. It expects a JSON formatted input and returns the compilation result in a JSON formatted output.

Where possible, the JSON formats used by this script follow those of `Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description>`_.

To compile from JSON supplied via ``stdin``:

::

    $ vyper-json

To compile from a JSON file:

::

    $ vyper-json yourProject.json

By default, the output is sent to ``stdout``. To redirect to a file, use the ``-o`` flag:

::

    $ vyper-json -o compiled.json

Input JSON Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example describes the expected input format of ``vyper-json``. Comments are of course not permitted and used here only for explanatory purposes.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        // Required: Source code language. Must be set to "Vyper".
        "language": "Vyper",
        // Required
        // Source codes given here will be compiled.
        "sources": {
            "contracts/foo.vy": {
                // Optional: keccak256 hash of the source file
                "keccak256": "0x234...",
                // Required: literal contents of the source file
                "content": "@public\ndef foo() -> bool:\n    return True"
            }
        },
        // Optional
        // Interfaces given here are made available for import by the sources
        // that are compiled. If the suffix is ".vy", the compiler will expect
        // a contract-as-interface using proper Vyper syntax. If the suffix is
        // "abi" the compiler will expect an ABI object.
        "interfaces": {
            "contracts/bar.vy": {
                "content": ""
            },
            "contracts/baz.json": {
                "abi": []
            }
        },
        // Optional
        "settings": {
            "evmVersion": "byzantium",  // EVM version to compile for. Can be byzantium, constantinople or petersburg.
            // The following is used to select desired outputs based on file names.
            // File names are given as keys, a star as a file name matches all files.
            // Outputs can also follow the Solidity format where second level keys
            // denoting contract names - all 2nd level outputs are applied to the file.
            //
            // To select all possible compiler outputs: "outputSelection: { '*': ["*"] }"
            // Note that this might slow down the compilation process needlessly.
            //
            // The available output types are as follows:
            //
            //    abi - The contract ABI
            //    ast - Abstract syntax tree
            //    interface - Derived interface of the contract, in proper Vyper syntax
            //    ir - LLL intermediate representation of the code
            //    evm.bytecode.object - Bytecode object
            //    evm.bytecode.opcodes - Opcodes list
            //    evm.deployedBytecode.object - Deployed bytecode object
            //    evm.deployedBytecode.opcodes - Deployed opcodes list
            //    evm.deployedBytecode.sourceMap - Deployed source mapping (useful for debugging)
            //    evm.methodIdentifiers - The list of function hashes
            //
            // Using `evm`, `evm.bytecode`, etc. will select every target part of that output.
            // Additionally, `*` can be used as a wildcard to request everything.
            //
            "outputSelection": {
                "*": ["evm.bytecode", "abi"],  // Enable the abi and bytecode outputs for every single contract
                "contracts/foo.vy": ["ast"]  // Enable the ast output for contracts/foo.vy
            }
        }
    }

            }
        }
    }

Importing Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``vyper-json`` searches for imported interfaces in the following sequence:

1. Interfaces defined in the ``interfaces`` field of the input JSON
2. Derived interfaces generated from contracts in the ``sources`` field of the input JSON
3. (Optional) The local filesystem, if a root path was explicitely declared via the ``-p`` flag.

See :ref:`searching_for_imports` for more information on Vyper's import system.

Errors
~~~~~~

Each error includes a ``component`` field, indicating the stage at which it occurred:

* ``json``: Errors that occur while parsing the input JSON. Usually a result of invalid JSON or a required value that is missing.
* ``parser``: Errors that occur while parsing the contracts. Usually a result of invalid Vyper syntax.
* ``compiler``: Errors that occur while compiling the contracts.
* ``vyper``: Unexpected errors that occur within Vyper. If you receive an error of this type, please open an issue.

You can also use the ``--traceback`` flag to receive a standard Python traceback when an error is encountered.


Online Compilers
================

Vyper Online Compiler
---------------------

`Vyper Online Compiler <https://vyper.online/>`_ is an online compiler which lets you experiment with the language without having to install Vyper. It allows you to compile to ``bytecode`` as well as ``LLL``.

.. note::

    While the vyper version of the online compiler is updated on a regular basis it might be a bit behind the latest version found in the master branch of the repository.

Remix IDE
---------

`Remix IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_ is a compiler and Javascript VM for developing and testing contracts in Vyper as well as Solidity.

.. note::

   While the vyper version of the Remix IDE compiler is updated on a regular basis it might be a bit behind the latest version found in the master branch of the repository. Make sure the byte code matches the output from your local compiler.

Compiling a Contract
********************

Command-Line Compiler Tools
===========================

Vyper includes the following command-line scripts for compiling contracts:

* ``vyper``: Compiles vyper contract or archive files
* ``vyper-json``: Provides a JSON interface to the compiler

.. note::

    The ``--help`` flag gives verbose explanations of how to use each of these scripts.

.. _vyper-cli-command:

vyper
-----

``vyper`` provides CLI access to the compiler. It can generate various outputs including simple binaries, ASTs, interfaces and source mappings.

To compile a contract:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper yourFileName.vy


Include the ``-f`` flag to specify which output formats to return. Use ``vyper --help`` for a full list of output options.

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper -f abi,abi_python,bytecode,bytecode_runtime,blueprint_bytecode,interface,external_interface,ast,annotated_ast,integrity,ir,ir_json,ir_runtime,asm,opcodes,opcodes_runtime,source_map,source_map_runtime,archive,solc_json,method_identifiers,userdoc,devdoc,metadata,combined_json,layout yourFileName.vy

.. note::
    The ``opcodes`` and ``opcodes_runtime`` output of the compiler has been returning incorrect opcodes since ``0.2.0`` due to a lack of 0 padding (patched via `PR 3735 <https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/pull/3735>`_). If you rely on these functions for debugging, please use the latest patched versions.

The ``-p`` flag allows you to set a root path that is used when searching for interface files to import.  If none is given, it will default to the current working directory. See :ref:`searching_for_imports` for more information.

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper -p yourProject yourProject/yourFileName.vy


.. _compiler-storage-layout:

Storage Layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To display the default storage layout for a contract:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper -f layout yourFileName.vy

This outputs a JSON object detailing the locations for all state variables as determined by the compiler.

To override the default storage layout for a contract:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper --storage-layout-file storageLayout.json yourFileName.vy

The input to the ``--storage-layout-file`` flag must match the format of the ``.storage_layout`` field from the ``vyper -f layout`` command.


.. _vyper-json:

vyper-json
----------

``vyper-json`` provides a JSON interface for the compiler. It expects a :ref:`JSON formatted input<vyper-json-input>` and returns the compilation result in a :ref:`JSON formatted output<vyper-json-output>`.

To compile from JSON supplied via ``stdin``:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper-json

To compile from a JSON file:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper-json yourProject.json

By default, the output is sent to ``stdout``. To redirect to a file, use the ``-o`` flag:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper-json -o compiled.json

Importing Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``vyper-json`` searches for imported interfaces in the following sequence:

1. Interfaces defined in the ``interfaces`` field of the input JSON.
2. Derived interfaces generated from contracts in the ``sources`` field of the input JSON.

See :ref:`searching_for_imports` for more information on Vyper's import system.

Online Compilers
================

Try VyperLang!
-----------------

`Try VyperLang! <https://try.vyperlang.org>`_ is a JupterHub instance hosted by the Vyper team as a sandbox for developing and testing contracts in Vyper. It requires github for login, and supports deployment via the browser.

Remix IDE
---------

`Remix IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_ is a compiler and JavaScript VM for developing and testing contracts in Vyper, as well as Solidity.

.. note::

   While the Vyper version of the Remix IDE compiler is updated on a regular basis, it might be a bit behind the latest version found in the master branch of the repository. Make sure the byte code matches the output from your local compiler.

.. _optimization-mode:

Compiler Optimization Modes
===========================

The Vyper CLI tool accepts an optimization mode ``"none"``, ``"codesize"``, or ``"gas"`` (default). It can be set using the ``--optimize`` flag. For example, invoking ``vyper --optimize codesize MyContract.vy`` will compile the contract, optimizing for code size. As a rough summary of the differences between gas and codesize mode, in gas optimized mode, the compiler will try to generate bytecode which minimizes gas (up to a point), including:

* using a sparse selector table which optimizes for gas over codesize
* inlining some constants, and
* trying to unroll some loops, especially for data copies.

In codesize optimized mode, the compiler will try hard to minimize codesize by

* using a dense selector table
* out-lining code, and
* using more loops for data copies.


.. _evm-version:

Setting the Target EVM Version
==============================

When you compile your contract code, you can specify the target Ethereum Virtual Machine version to compile for, to access or avoid particular features. You can specify the version either with a source code pragma or as a compiler option. It is recommended to use the compiler option when you want flexibility (for instance, ease of deploying across different chains), and the source code pragma when you want bytecode reproducibility (for instance, when verifying code on a block explorer).

.. note::
   If the evm version specified by the compiler options conflicts with the source code pragma, an exception will be raised and compilation will not continue.

For instance, the adding the following pragma to a contract indicates that it should be compiled for the "cancun" fork of the EVM.

.. code-block:: vyper

   #pragma evm-version cancun

.. warning::

    Compiling for the wrong EVM version can result in wrong, strange, or failing behavior. Please ensure, especially if running a private chain, that you use matching EVM versions.

When compiling via the ``vyper`` CLI, you can specify the EVM version option using the ``--evm-version`` flag:

.. code:: shell

    $ vyper --evm-version [VERSION]

When using the JSON interface, you can include the ``"evmVersion"`` key within the ``"settings"`` field:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "settings": {
            "evmVersion": "[VERSION]"
        }
    }

Target Options
--------------

The following is a list of supported EVM versions, and changes in the compiler introduced with each version. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed between each version. In general, the compiler team maintains an informal policy that the compiler will support 3 years of hard fork rulesets, but this policy may be revisited as appropriate.


.. py:attribute:: london

.. py:attribute:: paris

   - ``block.difficulty`` is deprecated in favor of its new alias, ``block.prevrandao``.

.. py:attribute:: shanghai

   - The ``PUSH0`` opcode is automatically generated by the compiler instead of ``PUSH1 0``

.. py:attribute:: cancun (default)

   - The ``transient`` keyword allows declaration of variables which live in transient storage
   - Functions marked with ``@nonreentrant`` are protected with TLOAD/TSTORE instead of SLOAD/SSTORE
   - The ``MCOPY`` opcode will be generated automatically by the compiler for most memory operations.

.. _integrity-hash:

Integrity Hash
==============

To help tooling detect whether two builds are the same, Vyper provides the ``-f integrity`` output, which outputs the integrity hash of a contract. The integrity hash is recursively defined as the sha256 of the source code with the integrity hashes of its dependencies (imports).

.. _vyper-archives:

Vyper Archives
==============

A Vyper archive is a compileable bundle of input sources and settings. Technically, it is a `ZIP file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)>`_, with a special structure to make it useable as input to the compiler. It can use any suffix, but the convention is to use a ``.zip`` suffix or ``.vyz`` suffix. It must contain a ``MANIFEST/`` folder, with the following directory structure.

::

    MANIFEST
    ├── cli_settings.txt
    ├── compilation_targets
    ├── compiler_version
    ├── integrity
    ├── searchpaths
    └── settings.json

* ``cli_settings.txt`` is a text representation of the settings that were used on the compilation run that generated this archive.
* ``compilation_targets`` is a newline separated list of compilation targets. Currently only one compilation is supported
* ``compiler_version`` is a text representation of the compiler version used to generate this archive
* ``integrity`` is the :ref:`integrity hash <integrity-hash>` of the input contract
* ``searchpaths`` is a newline-separated list of the search paths used on this compilation run
* ``settings.json`` is a json representation of the settings used on this compilation run. It is 1:1 with ``cli_settings.txt``, but both are provided as they are convenient for different workflows (typically, manually vs automated).

A Vyper archive file can be produced by requesting the ``-f archive`` output format. The compiler can also produce the archive in base64 encoded form using the ``--base64`` flag. The Vyper compiler can accept both ``.vyz`` and base64-encoded Vyper archives directly as input.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vyper -f archive my_contract.vy -o my_contract.vyz  # write the archive to my_contract.vyz
    $ vyper -f archive my_contract.vy --base64 > my_contract.vyz.b64  # write the archive, as base64-encoded text
    $ vyper my_contract.vyz  # compile my_contract.vyz
    $ vyper my_contract.vyz.b64  # compile my_contract.vyz.b64

Compiler Input and Output JSON Description
==========================================

JSON input/output is provided for compatibility with solidity, however, the recommended way is to use the aforementioned :ref:`Vyper archives <vyper-archives>`. So-called "standard json" input can be generated from a contract using the ``vyper -f solc_json`` output format.

Where possible, the Vyper JSON compiler formats follow those of `Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description>`_.

.. _vyper-json-input:

Input JSON Description
----------------------

The following example describes the expected input format of ``vyper-json``. (Comments are not normally permitted in JSON and are used here for explanatory purposes).

        // Optional
        // Sources given here are made available for import by the contracts
        // that are compiled. If the suffix is ".vy", the compiler will expect

            "evmVersion": "cancun",  // EVM version to compile for. Can be london, paris, shanghai or cancun (default).
            // optional, optimization mode
            // defaults to "gas". can be one of "gas", "codesize", "none",
            // false  and true (the last two are for backwards compatibility).
            "optimize": "gas",

            "search_paths": [],
            // The following is used to select desired outputs based on file names.
            // File names are given as keys, a star as a file name matches all files.
            // Outputs can also follow the Solidity format where second level keys
            // denoting contract names - all 2nd level outputs are applied to the file.
            //
            // To select all possible compiler outputs: "outputSelection: { '*': ["*"] }"
            // Note that this might slow down the compilation process needlessly.
            //

            //    interface - Derived interface of the contract, in proper Vyper syntax
            //    ir - intermediate representation of the code
            //    userdoc - Natspec user documentation
            //    devdoc - Natspec developer documentation

            //    evm.methodIdentifiers - The list of function hashes
            //
            // Using `evm`, `evm.bytecode`, etc. will select every target part of that output.
            // Additionally, `*` can be used as a wildcard to request everything.
            // Note that the sourceMapFull.pc_ast_map is the recommended source map to use;
            // the other types are included for legacy and compatibility reasons.
            //
            "outputSelection": {
                "*": ["evm.bytecode", "abi"],  // Enable the abi and bytecode outputs for every single contract
                "contracts/foo.vy": ["ast"]  // Enable the ast output for contracts/foo.vy

Errors
~~~~~~

Each error includes a ``component`` field, indicating the stage at which it occurred:

* ``json``: Errors that occur while parsing the input JSON. Usually, a result of invalid JSON or a required value that is missing.
* ``parser``: Errors that occur while parsing the contracts. Usually, a result of invalid Vyper syntax.
* ``compiler``: Errors that occur while compiling the contracts.
* ``vyper``: Unexpected errors that occur within Vyper. If you receive an error of this type, please open an issue.

You can also use the ``--traceback`` flag to receive a standard Python traceback when an error is encountered.

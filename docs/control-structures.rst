Functions
=========

Functions are executable units of code within a contract. Functions may only be declared within a contract's :ref:`module scope <scoping-module>`.

.. code-block:: python

    @external
    def bid():
        ...

Functions may be called internally or externally depending on their :ref:`visibility <function-visibility>`. Functions may accept input arguments and return variables in order to pass values between them.

.. _function-visibility:

Visibility
----------

All functions must include exactly one visibility decorator.

External Functions
******************

External functions (marked with the ``@external`` decorator) are a part of the contract interface and may only be called via transactions or from other contracts.

.. code-block:: python

    @external
    def add_seven(a: int128) -> int128:
        return a + 7

    @external
    def add_seven_with_overloading(a: uint256, b: uint256 = 3):
        return a + b

A Vyper contract cannot call directly between two external functions. If you must do this, you can use an :ref:`interface <interfaces>`.

.. note::
    For external functions with default arguments like ``def my_function(x: uint256, b: uint256 = 1)`` the Vyper compiler will generate ``N+1`` overloaded function selectors based on ``N`` default arguments.

.. _structure-functions-internal:

Internal Functions
******************

Internal functions (marked with the ``@internal`` decorator) are only accessible from other functions within the same contract. They are called via the :ref:`self<constants-self>` object:

.. code-block:: python

    @internal
    def _times_two(amount: uint256, two: uint256 = 2) -> uint256:
        return amount * two

    @external
    def calculate(amount: uint256) -> uint256:
        return self._times_two(amount)

.. note::
    Since calling an ``internal`` function is realized by jumping to its entry label, the internal function dispatcher ensures the correctness of the jumps. Please note that for ``internal`` functions which use more than one default parameter, Vyper versions ``>=0.3.8`` are strongly recommended due to the security advisory `GHSA-ph9x-4vc9-m39g <https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories/GHSA-ph9x-4vc9-m39g>`_.

Mutability
----------

.. _function-mutability:

You can optionally declare a function's mutability by using a :ref:`decorator <function-decorators>`. There are four mutability levels:

    * **Pure**: does not read from the contract state or any environment variables.
    * **View**: may read from the contract state, but does not alter it.
    * **Nonpayable**: may read from and write to the contract state, but cannot receive Ether.
    * **Payable**: may read from and write to the contract state, and can receive Ether.

.. code-block:: python

    @view
    @external
    def readonly():
        # this function cannot write to state
        ...

    @payable
    @external
    def send_me_money():
        # this function can receive ether
        ...

Functions default to ``nonpayable`` when no mutability decorator is used.

Functions marked with ``@view`` cannot call mutable (``payable`` or ``nonpayable``) functions. Any external calls are made using the special ``STATICCALL`` opcode, which prevents state changes at the EVM level.

Functions marked with ``@pure`` cannot call non-``pure`` functions.

Re-entrancy Locks
-----------------

The ``@nonreentrant(<key>)`` decorator places a lock on a function, and all functions with the same ``<key>`` value. An attempt by an external contract to call back into any of these functions causes the transaction to revert.

.. code-block:: python

    @external
    @nonreentrant("lock")
    def make_a_call(_addr: address):
        # this function is protected from re-entrancy
        ...

You can put the ``@nonreentrant(<key>)`` decorator on a ``__default__`` function but we recommend against it because in most circumstances it will not work in a meaningful way.

Nonreentrancy locks work by setting a specially allocated storage slot to a ``<locked>`` value on function entrance, and setting it to an ``<unlocked>`` value on function exit. On function entrance, if the storage slot is detected to be the ``<locked>`` value, execution reverts.

You cannot put the ``@nonreentrant`` decorator on a ``pure`` function. You can put it on a ``view`` function, but it only checks that the function is not in a callback (the storage slot is not in the ``<locked>`` state), as ``view`` functions can only read the state, not change it.

.. note::
    A mutable function can protect a ``view`` function from being called back into (which is useful for instance, if a ``view`` function would return inconsistent state during a mutable function), but a ``view`` function cannot protect itself from being called back into. Note that mutable functions can never be called from a ``view`` function because all external calls out from a ``view`` function are protected by the use of the ``STATICCALL`` opcode.

.. note::

    A nonreentrant lock has an ``<unlocked>`` value of 3, and a ``<locked>`` value of 2. Nonzero values are used to take advantage of net gas metering - as of the Berlin hard fork, the net cost for utilizing a nonreentrant lock is 2300 gas. Prior to v0.3.4, the ``<unlocked>`` and ``<locked>`` values were 0 and 1, respectively.


The ``__default__`` Function
--------------------------

A contract can also have a default function, which is executed on a call to the contract if no other functions match the given function identifier (or if none was supplied at all, such as through someone sending it Eth). It is the same construct as fallback functions `in Solidity <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=fallback#fallback-function>`_.

This function is always named ``__default__``. It must be annotated with ``@external``. It cannot expect any input arguments.

If the function is annotated as ``@payable``, this function is executed whenever the contract is sent Ether (without data). This is why the default function cannot accept arguments - it is a design decision of Ethereum to make no differentiation between sending ether to a contract or a user address.

.. code-block:: python

    event Payment:
        amount: uint256
        sender: indexed(address)

    @external
    @payable
    def __default__():
        log Payment(msg.value, msg.sender)

Considerations
**************

Just as in Solidity, Vyper generates a default function if one isn't found, in the form of a ``REVERT`` call. Note that this still `generates an exception <https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Subtleties>`_ and thus will not succeed in receiving funds.

Ethereum specifies that the operations will be rolled back if the contract runs out of gas in execution. ``send`` calls to the contract come with a free stipend of 2300 gas, which does not leave much room to perform other operations except basic logging. **However**, if the sender includes a higher gas amount through a ``call`` instead of ``send``, then more complex functionality can be run.

It is considered a best practice to ensure your payable default function is compatible with this stipend. The following operations will consume more than 2300 gas:

    * Writing to storage
    * Creating a contract
    * Calling an external function which consumes a large amount of gas
    * Sending Ether

Lastly, although the default function receives no arguments, it can still access the ``msg`` object, including:

    * the address of who is interacting with the contract (``msg.sender``)
    * the amount of ETH sent (``msg.value``)
    * the gas provided (``msg.gas``).

The ``__init__`` Function
-----------------------

``__init__`` is a special initialization function that may only be called at the time of deploying a contract. It can be used to set initial values for storage variables. A common use case is to set an ``owner`` variable with the creator the contract:

.. code-block:: python

    owner: address

    @external
    def __init__():
        self.owner = msg.sender

You cannot call to other contract functions from the initialization function.

.. _function-decorators:

Decorators Reference
--------------------

All functions must include one :ref:`visibility <function-visibility>` decorator (``@external`` or ``@internal``). The remaining decorators are optional.

=============================== ===========================================================
Decorator                       Description
=============================== ===========================================================
``@external``                   Function can only be called externally
``@internal``                   Function can only be called within current contract
``@pure``                       Function does not read contract state or environment variables
``@view``                       Function does not alter contract state
``@payable``                    Function is able to receive Ether
``@nonreentrant(<unique_key>)`` Function cannot be called back into during an external call
=============================== ===========================================================

``if`` statements
=================

The ``if`` statement is a control flow construct used for conditional execution:

.. code-block:: python

    if CONDITION:
        ...

``CONDITION`` is a boolean or boolean operation. The boolean is evaluated left-to-right, one expression at a time, until the condition is found to be true or false.  If true, the logic in the body of the ``if`` statement is executed.

Note that unlike Python, Vyper does not allow implicit conversion from non-boolean types within the condition of an ``if`` statement. ``if 1: pass`` will fail to compile with a type mismatch.

You can also include ``elif`` and ``else`` statements, to add more conditional statements and a body that executes when the conditionals are false:

.. code-block:: python

    if CONDITION:
        ...
    elif OTHER_CONDITION:
        ...
    else:
        ...

``for`` loops
=============

The ``for`` statement is a control flow construct used to iterate over a value:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in <ITERABLE>:
        ...

The iterated value can be a static array, a dynamic array, or generated from the built-in ``range`` function.

Array Iteration
---------------

You can use ``for`` to iterate through the values of any array variable:

.. code-block:: python

    foo: int128[3] = [4, 23, 42]
    for i in foo:
        ...

In the above, example, the loop executes three times with ``i`` assigned the values of ``4``, ``23``, and then ``42``.

You can also iterate over a literal array, as long as a common type can be determined for each item in the array:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in [4, 23, 42]:
        ...

Some restrictions:

* You cannot iterate over a multi-dimensional array.  ``i`` must always be a base type.
* You cannot modify a value in an array while it is being iterated, or call to a function that might modify the array being iterated.

Range Iteration
---------------

Ranges are created using the ``range`` function. The following examples are valid uses of ``range``:

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(STOP):
        ...

``STOP`` is a literal integer greater than zero. ``i`` begins as zero and increments by one until it is equal to ``STOP``.

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(START, STOP):
        ...

``START`` and ``STOP`` are literal integers, with ``STOP`` being a greater value than ``START``. ``i`` begins as ``START`` and increments by one until it is equal to ``STOP``.

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(a, a + N):
        ...

``a`` is a variable with an integer type and ``N`` is a literal integer greater than zero.  ``i`` begins as ``a`` and increments by one until it is equal to ``a + N``.

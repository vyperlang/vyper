ERC4626 Tokenized Vault
***********************

.. _erc4626:

.. warning::

   This is example code for learning purposes. Do not use in production without thorough review and testing.

ERC4626 standardizes yield-bearing vaults. Users deposit assets and receive shares
representing their portion of the vault.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tokens/ERC4626.vy
  :language: vyper
  :linenos:

The vault implements:

- ``deposit`` / ``withdraw``: Exchange assets for shares
- ``mint`` / ``redeem``: Exchange shares for assets
- Share price calculation based on ``totalAssets / totalSupply``

.. note::

   The ``DEBUG_steal_tokens`` function is for testing share price changes.
   Do not include in production code.

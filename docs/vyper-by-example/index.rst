Vyper by Example
################

This section contains practical examples demonstrating Vyper's features and common smart contract patterns.
Each example includes the full contract code and a detailed walkthrough of the implementation.

.. note::
  It's always important to keep security in mind when designing a smart
  contract. As any application becomes more complex, the greater the potential for
  introducing new risks. Thus, it's always good practice to keep contracts as
  readable and simple as possible.

ERC721 Non-Fungible Token
*************************

.. _erc721:

.. warning::

   This is example code for learning purposes. Do not use in production without thorough review and testing.

A standard ERC721 (NFT) implementation with minting and burning.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/tokens/ERC721.vy
  :language: vyper
  :linenos:

This implementation includes:

- ``mint`` and ``burn`` functions controlled by a minter address
- ``safeTransferFrom`` with receiver callback verification
- Operator approval via ``setApprovalForAll``
- ERC165 interface detection

The ``safeTransferFrom`` function checks if the recipient is a contract and, if so,
calls ``onERC721Received`` to ensure the recipient can handle NFTs.
